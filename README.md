# React Stockcharts

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Create highly customizable (stock) charts.

## Why This Fork?

The original **[react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts)** library, created by
[Ragu Ramaswamy](https://github.com/rrag), has been abandoned and unmaintained for an extended period. This has led
to outdated dependencies, compatibility issues with newer React versions, and various unresolved bugs.

**Our goal is to revive and modernize the library, ensuring its long-term usability and stability.**

### Key Improvements:

- **Updated Dependencies:** Resolving issues caused by outdated dependencies.
- **Bug Fixes:** Addressing critical issues and improving overall reliability.
- **React 19 Compatibility:** The original version supported React 15 and 16 and used deprecated class lifecycle
  methods. We are upgrading it for modern React.
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Providing continuous updates and support.
- **Feature Enhancements:** Expanding the libraryâ€™s capabilities to meet modern (stock) charting needs.

## Installation & Documentation

Comprehensive documentation and installation guides are in progress. Stay tuned for updates.
