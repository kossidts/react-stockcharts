Create highly customizable stock charts.

**This is the rebirth of the [react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts) library**, which is mainly built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The project has been abandoned, so I've cloned it in the hopes of updating it and making it work with updated dependencies.
